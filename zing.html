            <h2>Refining the watching experience</h2>
            <p>According to PwC Consumer Intelligence Series research,
                <b>2020 was a booming year</b> for streaming app services; the number of streaming users in the US has increased significantly.</p>
            <p>While the number of users has doubled, the quality of user experience still needs to catch up to the market's growth. It demands the streaming app developer to dive into more user research to make the user flows more seamless, come up with innovative solutions to satisfy the user's needs, and stand out among other streaming services.</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal for the Zing app was to create an interface that gives users comfort and ease of use incorporating solutions like voice control, a smart keyboard, and innovative mouse control with an AI application.</p>
            <h3>My role</h3>
            <p>I worked as a UX/UI designer on this project, from planning, UX analysis, user flow, lo-fi prototyping of the Zing app, and the high-fi prototyping process to UI design. There were time pressures, with the scope of work completed in just three-and-a-half months, from early February to mid-May of 2022.</p>
            <h2>Understanding the audience</h2>
            <p>To create a better user experience, it's best to understand how people watch and feel when using streaming services. During the research phase, I analyzed the needs, the features people would get excited about, and their struggles when using other streaming apps.</p>
            <p>Key findings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The main factor when choosing a streaming service is <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-video-streaming-behavior.html">the breadth of content</a>.</li>
              <li>The most influential factor people would love to see is <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-video-streaming-behavior.html">the ease of use</a>.</li>
              <li>A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-video-streaming-behavior.html">clean, intuitive user interface</a> gains more trust from consumers.</li>
              <li>29% of respondents said they were often <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-video-streaming-behavior.html">“frustrated”</a> by various choices.</li>
              <li>58% of respondents reported they used <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/784383/online-video-devices-in-the-us/">TVs</a> for streaming videos.</li>
              <li>“Pay TV subscribers <a>aged 35-49</a> showed the strongest inclination to use additional services.”</li>            
            </ul>

            <h3>Visualizing user pain points and needs</h3>
            <p>After gathering all the findings, I collected and formulated user personas to help understand user pain points and needs.</p>
            <div class="slideshow">
              <img src="/images/zing/Persona/clara 1.png" alt="persona" width="100%">

              <img src="/images/zing/Persona/joey 1.png" alt="personaa" width="100%">
            </div>
            <p>From there, I constructed user empathy maps and user journeys for my personas. This step helped me go through user thoughts and feelings to map out the main issue I should solve to help users achieve their goals.</p>

            <h2>Ideate and design</h2>
            <h3>User flow</h3>
            <p>I devised a single-branch task flow on how the audience could search for and watch a specific movie/show. This simple task flow was an indicator to help the future complex user flow be more comprehensive.</p>
            <p>The specific task here was to search and watch a show called “Crash Landing On You” using the voice command via the remote control.</p>
            <img src="/images/zing/task flow.jpg" alt="task flow" width="100%">
            <p>Then, I created a more complex user flow based on the simple task flow. In this step, I went into more detail about what users would do and choose with the same task. </p>
            <img src="/images/zing/user flow.jpg" alt="user flow" width="100%">
            <h3>Low-fidelity wireframe</h3>
            <p>My lo-fi wireframe would mainly focus on testing how users interact with the streaming app and can search and watch the requested show. </p>
            <p>When designing the remote control for the app, I intended to keep it as simple as possible, with fewer buttons than the regular remote in the market. Why? I cannot count how many times I have felt so stressed because of the number of buttons on the typical remote. Moreover, I only use a few of them to operate some primary functions. And I am the only one with that experience with the old-styled remote?</p>

            <p>This same rule applies to the remote design; our users should feel calm and encouraged to use the product effortlessly. </p>
            <p>The main prototyping screen device wireframe was still the TV screen, as more than half of the responders reported using TVs for streaming services. </p>
            <p>The new remote design still had a circular trackpad to navigate around the screen when users don't use the voice control feature.</p>

            <img src="/images/zing/paper prototype/remote.jpg" alt="remote sketch" width="100%">
            <p>Users would have the option to switch between the digital key and the voice command, referring to their likings. </p>
            <img src="/images/zing/paper prototype/Voice search.jpg" alt="voice search" width="100%">
            <img src="/images/zing/paper prototype/Keyboard search.jpg" alt="keyboard search" width="100%">
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>During the usability test with the Thinking Out Loud protocol method, I asked participants to search for a show named “Crash landing on you” using a remote control and speak aloud what they were thinking while completing their tasks. They were offered to choose between voice control, cursor control, and regular digital keyboard. Overall, they enjoyed the cursor and voice control and would love to use these features in reality.</p>

            <h3>High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
            <p>After gathering the feedback, I went back to the ideation phase, made more adjustments, and created the hi-fi wireframes.</p>
            <p>Voice control feature:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users will have a list of commands to ask the app.</li>
              <li>On the remote. There are three choices on how users can navigate.</li>
              <li>A simplified remote design will feature just a few buttons to reduce customer frustration.</li>
              <li>Pressing the mic button on the remote will activate the voice control.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="slideshow">
              <img src="/images/zing/hi-fi design/command example.jpg" alt="command" width="100%">
              <img src="/images/zing/hi-fi design/remote.jpg" alt="remote" width="100%">
            </div>
            <p>The search process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users can use either the keyboard or voice command to find movies.</li>
              <li>Users can speak directly to the app to input commands with AI support.</li>
              <li>The commands then appear on the input box in the top right corner.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="slideshow">
              <img src="/images/zing/hi-fi design/Qwerty search page.jpg" alt="qwerty keyboard" width="100%">
              <img src="/images/zing/hi-fi design/search page with voice.jpg" alt="voice search" width="100%">
            </div>
            <p>Besides the keyboard and voice control, there is also the cursor feature. By activating the cursor on the remote, users can use the remote as an indicator to point out their selections and press the Play button to confirm. </p>

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessing a streaming service is vital because it directly affects the user experience. Our app has to run on a wide range of devices, and it can be challenging for the developer and designer teams whenever those devices update their technologies. Therefore, the design and development process should be quick and effective.</li>
              <li>Using the remote control to input movie names can be improved by studying user behaviors using different input methods.</li>
              <li>Besides the standard digital keyboard, voice control and cursor control should be studied more and implemented for future use to help increase accessibility to a variety of audiences and benefit the streaming industry.</li>
              <li>Regarding the overall design experience, this project taught me to apply good UI/UX practices in the design process on smart TVs, other than apps and websites.</li>
